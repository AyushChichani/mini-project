            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty.Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.

                Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot
                of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to
                teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as
                possible.[citation needed] Finnish schools have begun to move away from the regular subject-focused
                curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study
                concepts like climate change instead. There are also active educational interventions to implement
                programs and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as first generation students.

                Education is also becoming[when?] a commodity no longer reserved for children; adults need it too. Some
                governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have proposed compulsory
                lifelong education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to
                education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of
                technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in
                developing countries.Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures
                through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

                The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a
                stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely
                available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

                In Africa, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an "e-school program" to
                provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet
                access within 10 years. An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com, started with the
                support of former American President Bill Clinton, uses the Internet to allow co-operation by
                individuals on issues of social development.</p>
